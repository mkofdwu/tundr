UPDATE: this project has been discontinued lol

tundr is a dating app for high schools. currently, it is only available for android since I can't afford the apple developer license.

this was my first flutter project and the code is pretty messed up, and this project is not actively maintained. if i have time in the future I may refactor everything with a new architecture and implement a redesign.

## running

this project uses flavors. create a firebase project and place the google-services.json in android/app/src/dev.
enable email password and phone authentication, firestore, cloud functions and storage.
deploy cloud functions

## tests

as of now there are very few tests written and most of them dont run
